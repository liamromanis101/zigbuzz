Currently a simple tool to identify ZigBee packet types and extract some data from pcap files. 

No particular purpose as yet, just part of my learning cycle..

Uses pyshark and lxml.objectify

You will need tshark install. 

Some sample ZigBee pcap file here: https://tshark.dev/search/pcaptable/
Search for "zbee"
